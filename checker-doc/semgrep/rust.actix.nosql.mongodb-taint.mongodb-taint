Untrusted input might be used to build a database query, which can lead to a NoSQL injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious NoSQL statements and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify, delete data, or execute arbitrary system commands. Make sure all user input is validated and sanitized, and avoid using tainted user input to construct NoSQL statements if possible. Ideally, avoid raw queries and instead use parameterized queries.
