Untrusted input might be injected into a command executed by the application, which can lead to a command injection vulnerability. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands, potentially gaining complete control of the system. To prevent this vulnerability, avoid executing OS commands with user input. If this is unavoidable, validate and sanitize the input, and use safe methods for executing the commands.
