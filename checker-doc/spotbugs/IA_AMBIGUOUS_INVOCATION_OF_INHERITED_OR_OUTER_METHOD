An inner class is invoking a method that could be resolved to either an inherited method or a method defined in an outer class, e.g., you invoke foo(17), which is defined in both a superclass and in an outer method. By the Java semantics, it will be resolved to invoke the inherited method, but this may not be what you intend.
