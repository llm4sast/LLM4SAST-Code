A call to notify() or notifyAll() was made without any (apparent) accompanying modification to mutable object state.  In general, calling a notify method on a monitor is done because some condition another thread is waiting for has become true.  However, for the condition to be meaningful, it must involve a heap object that is visible to both threads.
