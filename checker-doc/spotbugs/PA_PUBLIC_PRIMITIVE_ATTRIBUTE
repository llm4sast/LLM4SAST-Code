The rule requires that accessibility to fields must be limited. Otherwise, the values of the fields may be manipulated from outside the class, which may be unexpected or undesired behaviour. In general, requiring that no fields are allowed to be public is overkill and unrealistic. Even the rule mentions that final fields may be public. Besides final fields, there may be other usages for public fields: some public fields may serve as "flags" that affect the behavior of the class.
