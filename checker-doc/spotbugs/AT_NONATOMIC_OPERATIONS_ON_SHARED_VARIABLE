This write of a variable shared between functions depends on the current value of the variable (either because it's a compound operation - e.g. +=, ++ - or it simply depends on the current value), as such it consists of more than one discrete operation. These operations are not atomic in themselves and need further synchronization. To solve this issue, synchronize compound operations and other write operations depending on the previous value, use read-write locks, or declare the shared variable with an atomic type.
