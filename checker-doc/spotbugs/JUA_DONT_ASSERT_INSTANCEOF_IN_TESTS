Asserting type checks in tests is not recommended as a class cast exception message could better indicate the cause of an instance of the wrong class being used than an instanceof assertion. When debugging tests that fail due to bad casts, it may be more useful to observe the output of the resulting ClassCastException which could provide information about the actual encountered type.
