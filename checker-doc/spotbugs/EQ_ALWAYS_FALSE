The class defines an equals method that always returns false. This means an object is not equal to itself, and it is impossible to create useful Maps or Sets of this class. Fundamentally, it means equals is not reflexive, one of the requirements of the equals method. The intended semantics are object identity: an object is equal to itself. This is the behavior inherited from class Object.
