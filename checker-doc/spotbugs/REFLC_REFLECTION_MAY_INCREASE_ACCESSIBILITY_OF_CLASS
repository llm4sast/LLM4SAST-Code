SEI CERT SEC05-J rule forbids the use of reflection to increase accessibility of classes, methods or fields. If a class in a package provides a public method which takes an instance of java.lang.Class as its parameter and calls its newInstance() method then it increases accessibility of classes in the same package without public constructors. An attacker code may call this method and pass such class to create an instance of it. This should be avoided by either making the method non-public or by checking for package access permission on the package. A third possibility is to use the java.beans.Beans.instantiate() method instead of java.lang.Class.newInstance() which checks whether the Class object being received has any public constructors.
