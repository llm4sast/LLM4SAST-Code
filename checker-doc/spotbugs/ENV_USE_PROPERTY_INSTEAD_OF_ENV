Environment variables are not portable, the variable name itself (not only the value) may be different depending on the running OS. Not only the names of the specific environment variables can differ (e.g. `USERNAME` in Windows and `USER` in Unix systems), but even the semantics differ, e.g. the case sensitivity (Windows being case-insensitive and Unix case-sensitive). For these reasons, if a value can be accessed through both System.getProperty() and System.getenv(), it should be accessed using the former.
