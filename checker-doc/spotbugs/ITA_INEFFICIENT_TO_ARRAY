A method uses the toArray() method of a collection derived class, and passes in a zero-length prototype array argument. It is more efficient to use myCollection.toArray(new Foo[myCollection.size()]) If the array passed in is big enough to store all the elements of the collection, then it is populated and returned directly. This avoids the need to create a second array (by reflection) to return as the result.
