This class defines a hashCode() method but inherits its equals() method from java.lang.Object (which defines equality by comparing object references). Although this will probably satisfy the contract that equal objects must have equal hashcodes, it is probably not what was intended by overriding the hashCode() method (Overriding hashCode() implies that the object's identity is based on criteria more complicated than simple reference equality).
