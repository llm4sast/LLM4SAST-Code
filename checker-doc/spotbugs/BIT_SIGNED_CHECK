A method compares an expression such as ((event.detail & SWT.SELECTED) > 0). Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can lead to unexpected results (of course depending on the value of SWT.SELECTED). If SWT.SELECTED is a negative number, this is a candidate for a bug. Even when SWT.SELECTED is not negative, it seems good practice to use '!= 0' instead of '> 0'.
