A method performs synchronization on an object that is an instance of a class from the java.util.concurrent package (or its subclasses). Instances of these classes have their own concurrency control mechanisms that are orthogonal to the synchronization provided by the Java keyword synchronized, e.g., synchronizing on an AtomicBoolean will not prevent other threads from modifying the AtomicBoolean.
