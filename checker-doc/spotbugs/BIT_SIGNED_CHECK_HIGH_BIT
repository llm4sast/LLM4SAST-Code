A method compares a bitwise expression such as ((val & CONSTANT) > 0) where CONSTANT is the negative number. Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can lead to unexpected results. This comparison is unlikely to work as expected. The good practice is to use '!= 0' instead of '> 0'.
