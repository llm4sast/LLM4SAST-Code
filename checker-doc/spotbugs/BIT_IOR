A method compares an expression of the form (e | C) to D. which will always compare unequal due to the specific values of constants C and D. This may indicate a logic error or typo. Typically, this bug occurs because the code wants to perform a membership test in a bit set, but uses the bitwise OR operator ("|") instead of bitwise AND ("&"). Also such bug may appear in expressions like (e & A | B) == C which is parsed like ((e & A) | B) == C while (e & (A | B)) == C was intended.
