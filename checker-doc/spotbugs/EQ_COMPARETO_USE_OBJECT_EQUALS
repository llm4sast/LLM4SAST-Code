A class defines a compareTo method but inherits its equals() method from java.lang.Object. Generally, the value of compareTo should return zero iff equals returns true. If this is violated, weird and unpredictable failures will occur in classes such as PriorityQueue. In Java 5 the PriorityQueue.remove method uses the compareTo method, while in Java 6 it uses the equals method. From the JavaDoc for the compareTo method in the Comparable interface: It is strongly recommended, but not strictly required that (x.compareTo(y)==0) == (x.equals(y)). Any class that implements the Comparable interface and violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.
