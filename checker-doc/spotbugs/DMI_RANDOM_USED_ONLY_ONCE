This code creates a java.util.Random object, uses it to generate one random number, and then discards the Random object. This produces mediocre quality random numbers and is inefficient. If possible, rewrite the code so that the Random object is created once and saved, and each time a new random number is required invoke a method on the existing Random object to obtain it. If it is important that generated Random numbers not be guessable, you must not create a new Random for each random number; the values are too easily guessable. Consider using a java.security.SecureRandom instead (and avoid allocating a new SecureRandom for each random number needed).
