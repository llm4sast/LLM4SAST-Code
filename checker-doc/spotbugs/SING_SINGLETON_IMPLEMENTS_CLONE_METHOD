This class is using singleton design pattern and does not implement the Cloneable interface, but implements the clone() method without being an unconditional CloneNotSupportedException-thrower. With that, it is possible to create a copy of the object, thus violating the singleton pattern. Therefore, implementing the clone method should be avoided, otherwise the solution would be overriding the clone method to unconditionally throw CloneNotSupportedException.
