This rule requires that custom class loaders must always call their superclass's getPermissions() method in their own getPermissions() method to initialize the object they return at the end. Omitting it means that a class defined using this custom class loader has permissions that are completely independent of those specified in the systemwide policy file. In effect, the class's permissions override them.
