The software uses an HTTP request parameter to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. SpotBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of absolute path traversal. If SpotBugs found any, you almost certainly have more vulnerabilities that SpotBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about absolute path traversal, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.
