This code constructs an HTTP Cookie using an untrusted HTTP parameter. If this cookie is added to an HTTP response, it will allow an HTTP response splitting vulnerability. SpotBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of HTTP response splitting. If SpotBugs found any, you almost certainly have more vulnerabilities that SpotBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about HTTP response splitting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.
