A method contains an explicit invocation of the finalize() method on an object.  Because finalizer methods are supposed to be executed once, and only by the VM, this is a bad idea. If a connected set of objects beings finalizable, then the VM will invoke the finalize method on all the finalizable object, possibly at the same time in different threads. Thus, it is a particularly bad idea, in the finalize method for a class X, invoke finalize on objects referenced by X, because they may already be getting finalized in a separate thread.
