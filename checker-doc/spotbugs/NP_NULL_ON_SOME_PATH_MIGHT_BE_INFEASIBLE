There is a branch of statement that, if executed, guarantees that a null value will be dereferenced, which would generate a NullPointerException when the code is executed. The problem might be the branch or statement is infeasible and that the null pointer exception cannot ever be executed; deciding that is beyond the ability of SpotBugs. Due to the fact that this value had been previously tested for nullness, this is a definite possibility.
