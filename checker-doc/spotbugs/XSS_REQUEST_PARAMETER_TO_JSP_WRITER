This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to JSP output, which allows for a cross site scripting vulnerability. SpotBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of cross site scripting. If SpotBugs found any, you almost certainly have more cross site scripting vulnerabilities that SpotBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about cross site scripting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.
