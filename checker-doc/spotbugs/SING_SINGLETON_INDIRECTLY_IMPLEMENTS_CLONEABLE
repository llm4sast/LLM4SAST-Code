If a class using singleton design pattern indirectly implements the Cloneable interface, it is possible to create a copy of the object, thus violating the singleton pattern. Therefore, implementing the Cloneable interface should be avoided. If that's not possible because of an extended super-class, the solution would be overriding the clone method to unconditionally throw CloneNotSupportedException.
