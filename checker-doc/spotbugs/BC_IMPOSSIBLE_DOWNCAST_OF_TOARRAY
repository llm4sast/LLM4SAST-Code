The code is casting the result of calling toArray() on a collection to a type more specific than Object[]. This will usually fail by throwing a ClassCastException. The toArray() of almost all collections return an Object[]. They cannot really do anything else, since the Collection object has no reference to the declared generic type of the collection. The correct way to do get an array of a specific type from a collection is to use c.toArray(new String[0]); or c.toArray(new String[c.size()]); (the former is slightly more efficient since late Java 6 updates). There is one common/known exception to this. The toArray() method of lists returned by Arrays.asList will return a covariantly typed array, e.g., Arrays.asArray(new String[] {"a"}).toArray() will return a String []. SpotBugs attempts to detect and suppress such cases, but may miss some.
