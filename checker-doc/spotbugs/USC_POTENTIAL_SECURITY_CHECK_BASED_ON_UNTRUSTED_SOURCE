A public method of a public class may be called from outside the package which means that untrusted data may be passed to it. Calling a method before the doPrivileged to check its return value and then calling the same method inside the class is dangerous if the method or its enclosing class is not final. An attacker may pass an instance of a malicious descendant of the class instead of an instance of the expected one where this method is overridden in a way that it returns different values upon different invocations, e.g., a method returning a file path may return a harmless path to check before entering the doPrivileged block and then a sensitive file upon the call inside the doPrivileged block.
