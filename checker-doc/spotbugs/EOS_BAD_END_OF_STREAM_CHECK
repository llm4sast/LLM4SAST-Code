The method java.io.FileInputStream.read() returns an int. If this int is converted to a byte then -1 (which indicates an EOF) and the byte 0xFF become indistinguishable, this comparing the (converted) result to -1 causes the read (probably in a loop) to end prematurely if the character 0xFF is met. Similarly, the method java.io.FileReader.read() also returns an int. If it is converted to a char then -1 becomes 0xFFFF which is Character.MAX_VALUE. Comparing the result to -1 is pointless, since characters are unsigned in Java. If the checking for EOF is the condition of a loop then this loop is infinite.
