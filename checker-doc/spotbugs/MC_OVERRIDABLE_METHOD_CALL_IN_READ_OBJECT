The readObject() method must not call any overridable methods. Invoking overridable methods from the readObject() method can provide the overriding method with access to the object's state before it is fully initialized. This premature access is possible because, in deserialization, readObject plays the role of object constructor and therefore object initialization is not complete until readObject exits.
