Returning a reference to a buffer (java.nio.*Buffer) which wraps an array stored in one of the object's fields exposes the internal representation of the array elements because the buffer only stores a reference to the array instead of copying its content. Similarly, returning a shallow-copy of such a buffer (using its duplicate() method) stored in one of the object's fields also exposes the internal representation of the buffer. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the array would compromise security or other important properties.
