This class inherits equals(Object) from an abstract superclass, and hashCode() from java.lang.Object (which returns the identity hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object by the VM).  Therefore, the class is very likely to violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes. If you don't want to define a hashCode method, and/or don't believe the object will ever be put into a HashMap/Hashtable, define the hashCode() method to throw UnsupportedOperationException.
