SEI CERT SEC05-J rule forbids the use of reflection to increase accessibility of classes, methods or fields. If a class in a package provides a public method which takes an instance of java.lang.reflect.Field as its parameter and calls a setter (or setAccessible()) method then it increases accessibility of fields in the same package which are private, protected or package private. An attacker code may call this method and pass such field to change it. This should be avoided by either making the method non-public or by checking for package access permission on the package.
