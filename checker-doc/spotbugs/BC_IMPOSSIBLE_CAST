This cast will always throw a ClassCastException. SpotBugs tracks type information from instanceof checks, and also uses more precise information about the types of values returned from methods and loaded from fields. Thus, it may have more precise information than just the declared type of a variable, and can use this to determine that a cast will always throw an exception at runtime.
