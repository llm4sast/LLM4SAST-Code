This equals method is checking to see if the argument is some incompatible type (i.e., a class that is neither a supertype nor subtype of the class that defines the equals method), e.g., the Foo class might have an equals method that looks like:
```
public boolean equals(Object o) {
 if (o instanceof Foo) return name.equals(((Foo)o).name);
 else if (o instanceof String) return name.equals(o); else return false;
}
```
This is considered bad practice, as it is very hard to implement an equals method symmetric and transitive.
