Array of covariant type is assigned to a local variable. This is confusing and may lead to ArrayStoreException at runtime if the reference of some other type will be stored in this array later like in the code `Number[] arr = new Integer[10]; arr[0] = 1.0;`. Consider changing the type of created array or the local variable type.
