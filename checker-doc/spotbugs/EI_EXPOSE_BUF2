This code creates a buffer which stores a reference to an external array or the array of an external buffer into the internal representation of the object.  If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the array would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. Storing a copy of the array is a better approach in many situations.
