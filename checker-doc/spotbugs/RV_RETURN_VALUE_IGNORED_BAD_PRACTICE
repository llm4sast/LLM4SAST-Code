A method returns a value that is not checked. The return value should be checked since it can indicate an unusual or unexpected function execution, e.g., the File.delete() method returns false if the file could not be successfully deleted (rather than throwing an Exception). If you don't check the result, you won't notice if the method invocation signals unexpected behavior by returning an atypical return value.
