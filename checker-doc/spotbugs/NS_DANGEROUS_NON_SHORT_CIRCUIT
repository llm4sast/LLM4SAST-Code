This code seems to be using non-short-circuit logic (e.g., & or |) rather than short-circuit logic (&& or ||). In addition, it seems that, depending on the value of the left hand side, you might not want to evaluate the right hand side because it would have side effects, could cause an exception or could be expensive.
