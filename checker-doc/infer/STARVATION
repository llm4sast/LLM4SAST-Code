This error is reported in Java, and specifically on Android. These reports are triggered when a method that runs on the UI thread may block, thus potentially leading to an Application Not Responding error. Infer considers a method as running on the UI thread whenever: (1)The method, one of its overrides, its class, or an ancestral class, is annotated with @UiThread; (2)The method, or one of its overrides is annotated with @OnEvent/@OnClick; (3)The method or its callees call a Litho.ThreadUtils method such as assertMainThread. The issue is reported when a method deemed to run on the UI thread makes a method call which may block or takes a lock, and another thread takes the same lock, and before releasing it, makes a call that may block.
