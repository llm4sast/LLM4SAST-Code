In general, resources are entities such as files, sockets, connections, etc, that need to be closed after being used. In the following example, the object `fos` is not closed.
```java
public void foo () throws IOException {
  FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("name.txt"));
  fos.write(7);
}
```
