This is reported when an address at an absolute location, e.g. 1234, is dereferenced. It is a more general version of the NULLPTR_DEREFERENCE error type that is reported when the address is a constant other than zero. For example, int *p = (int *) 123; *p = 42; generates a CONSTANT_ADDRESS_DEREFERENCE on *p = 42;.
