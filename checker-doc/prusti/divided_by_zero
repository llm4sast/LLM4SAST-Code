In Rust, divided_by_zero is a critical error. Division by zero is not allowed as it leads to undefined behavior. When a program attempts integer division by zero, Rust will typically cause a panic at runtime. For floating - point division, the result may be NaN (Not a Number) or infinity, depending on the operands. Rust's strict handling of division by zero helps prevent hard - to - debug issues and ensures program reliability.
