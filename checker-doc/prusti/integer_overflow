In Rust, integer_overflow occurs when an integer calculation exceeds the maximum or minimum value that the integer type can represent. For example, adding two large positive integers of a specific integer type might result in a value beyond its upper limit. By default, in debug builds, Rust panics when an integer overflow is detected during arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. This helps catch potential bugs early. In release builds, integer overflow is often silently truncated, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered. Rust also provides ways to handle integer overflow explicitly, such as using the checked_* methods, which return None instead of panicking when an overflow occurs, allowing developers to manage these situations gracefully.
