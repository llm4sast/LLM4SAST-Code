Configurable naming conventions for formal parameters of methods and lambdas. This rule reports formal parameters which do not match the regex that applies to their specific kind (e.g. lambda parameter, or final formal parameter). Each regex can be configured through properties. By default this rule uses the standard Java naming convention (Camel case).
