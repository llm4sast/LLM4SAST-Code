If a class is marked as Serializable, then all fields need to be serializable as well. In order to exclude a field, it can be marked as transient. Static fields are not considered. This rule reports all fields, that are not serializable. If a class implements the methods to perform manual serialization (writeObject, readObject) or uses a replacement object (writeReplace, readResolve) then this class is ignored.
