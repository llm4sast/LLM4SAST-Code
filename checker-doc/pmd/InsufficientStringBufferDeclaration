Failing to pre-size a StringBuffer or StringBuilder properly could cause it to re-size many times during runtime. This rule attempts to determine the total number the characters that are actually passed into StringBuffer.append(), but represents a best guess "worst case" scenario. An empty StringBuffer/StringBuilder constructor initializes the object to 16 characters. This default is assumed if the length of the constructor can not be determined.
