Reports JUnit 5 test classes and methods that are not package-private. Contrary to JUnit 4 tests, which required public visibility to be run by the engine, JUnit 5 tests can also be run if they're package-private. Marking them as such is a good practice to limit their visibility. Test methods are identified as those which use @Test, @RepeatedTest, @TestFactory, @TestTemplate or @ParameterizedTest.
