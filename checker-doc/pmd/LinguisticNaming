This rule finds Linguistic Naming Antipatterns. It checks for fields, that are named, as if they should be boolean but have a different type. It also checks for methods, that according to their name, should return a boolean, but don't. Further, it checks, that getters return something and setters won't. Finally, it checks that methods, that start with "to" - so called transform methods - actually return something, since according to their name, they should convert or transform one object into another. There is additionally an option, to check for methods that contain "To" in their name - which are also transform methods. However, this is disabled by default, since this detection is prone to false positives.
