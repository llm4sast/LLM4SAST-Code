Reports assignments to variables that are never used before the variable is overwritten, or goes out of scope. Unused assignments are those for which 1. The variable is never read after the assignment, or 2. The assigned value is always overwritten by other assignments before the next read of the variable. The rule tracks assignements to fields of this, and static fields of the current class. This may cause some false positives in timing-sensitive concurrent code, which the rule cannot detect.
