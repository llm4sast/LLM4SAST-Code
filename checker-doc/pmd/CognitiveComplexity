Methods that are highly complex are difficult to read and more costly to maintain. If you include too much decisional logic within a single method, you make its behavior hard to understand and more difficult to modify. Cognitive complexity is a measure of how difficult it is for humans to read and understand a method. Code that contains a break in the control flow is more complex, whereas the use of language shorthands doesn't increase the level of complexity. Nested control flows can make a method more difficult to understand, with each additional nesting of the control flow leading to an increase in cognitive complexity.
