The complexity of methods directly affects maintenance costs and readability. Concentrating too much decisional logic in a single method makes its behaviour hard to read and change. Cyclomatic complexity assesses the complexity of a method by counting the number of decision points in a method, plus one for the method entry. Decision points are places where the control flow jumps to another place in the program.
