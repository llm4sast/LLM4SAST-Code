Reports parameters of methods and constructors that are not referenced them in the method body. Parameters whose name starts with ignored or unused are filtered out. Removing unused formal parameters from public methods could cause a ripple effect through the code base. Hence, by default, this rule only considers private methods. To include non-private methods, set the checkAll property to true.
