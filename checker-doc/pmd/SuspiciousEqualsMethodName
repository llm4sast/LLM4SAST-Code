The method name and parameter number are suspiciously close to Object.equals, which can denote an intention to override it. However, the method does not override Object.equals, but overloads it instead. Overloading Object.equals method is confusing for other programmers, error-prone and hard to maintain, especially when using inheritance, because @Override annotations used in subclasses can provide a false sense of security.
