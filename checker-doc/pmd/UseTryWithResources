Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement. This statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement. It avoids the need of explicitly closing the resources in a finally block. Additionally exceptions are better handled: If an exception occurred both in the try block and finally block, then the exception from the try block was suppressed. With the try-with-resources statement, the exception thrown from the try-block is preserved.
