Detects casts which could be removed as the operand of the cast is already suitable for the context type. For instance, in the following:  Object context = (Comparable) "o";  The cast is unnecessary. This is because String already is a subtype of both Comparable and Object. This will also flag casts that can be avoided because of the autoboxing feature of Java 5. Integer integer = (Integer) 1;  The literal would be autoboxed to Integer anyway.
