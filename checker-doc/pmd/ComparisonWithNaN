Reports comparisons with double and float NaN (Not-a-Number) values. These are unintuitive behaviors: NaN is considered unequal to itself. This means a check like someDouble == Double.NaN will always return false, even if someDouble is really the NaN value. To test whether a value is the NaN value, one should instead use Double.isNaN(someDouble) (or Float.isNaN). The != operator should be treated similarly. Finally, comparisons like someDouble <= Double.NaN are nonsensical and will always evaluate to false.
