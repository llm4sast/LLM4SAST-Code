Calls to a collection's toArray(E[]) method should specify a target array of zero size. This allows the JVM to optimize the memory allocation and copying as much as possible. Previous versions of this rule (pre PMD 6.0.0) suggested the opposite, but current JVM implementations perform always better, when they have full control over the target array. And allocation an array via reflection is nowadays as fast as the direct allocation.
