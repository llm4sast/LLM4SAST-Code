Web applications should not call System.exit(), since only the web container or the application server should stop the JVM. Otherwise a web application would terminate all other applications running on the same application server. This rule also checks for the equivalent calls Runtime.getRuntime().exit() and Runtime.getRuntime().halt(). This rule has been renamed from "DoNotCallSystemExit" in PMD 6.29.0.
