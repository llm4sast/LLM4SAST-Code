Reports unnecessary semicolons (so called "empty statements" and "empty declarations"). These can be removed without changing the program. The Java grammar allows them for historical reasons, but they should be avoided. This rule will not report empty statements that are syntactically  required, for instance, because they are the body of a control statement. This rule replaces EmptyStatementNotInLoop.
