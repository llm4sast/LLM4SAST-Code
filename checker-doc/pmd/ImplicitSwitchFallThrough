Switch statements without break or return statements for each case option may indicate problematic behaviour. Empty cases are ignored as these indicate an intentional fall-through. You can ignore a violation by commenting // fallthrough before the case label which is reached by fallthrough, or with @SuppressWarnings("fallthrough"). This rule has been renamed from "MissingBreakInSwitch" in PMD 6.37.0.
