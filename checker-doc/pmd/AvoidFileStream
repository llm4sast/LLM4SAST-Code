The FileInputStream and FileOutputStream classes contains a finalizer method which will cause garbage collection pauses. The FileReader and FileWriter constructors instantiate FileInputStream and FileOutputStream, again causing garbage collection issues while finalizer methods are called. Use Files.newInputStream(Paths.get(fileName)) instead of new FileInputStream(fileName), use Files.newOutputStream(Paths.get(fileName)) instead of new FileOutputStream(fileName), use Files.newBufferedReader(Paths.get(fileName)) instead of new FileReader(fileName), and use Files.newBufferedWriter(Paths.get(fileName)) instead of new FileWriter(fileName).
