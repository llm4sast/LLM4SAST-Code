Use equals() to compare object references; avoid comparing them with ==. Since comparing objects with named constants is useful in some cases (eg, when defining constants for sentinel values), the rule ignores comparisons against fields with all-caps name (eg this == SENTINEL), which is a common naming convention for constant fields.
