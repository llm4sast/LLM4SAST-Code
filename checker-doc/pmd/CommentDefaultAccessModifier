To avoid mistakes if we want that an Annotation, Class, Enum, Method, Constructor or Field have a default access modifier we must add a comment at the beginning of its declaration. By default, the comment must be /* default */ or /* package */, if you want another, you have to provide a regular expression. This rule ignores by default all cases that have a @VisibleForTesting annotation or any JUnit5/TestNG annotation. Use the property "ignoredAnnotations" to customize the recognized annotations.
