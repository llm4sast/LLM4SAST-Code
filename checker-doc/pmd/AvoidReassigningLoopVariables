Reassigning loop variables can lead to hard-to-find bugs. Prevent or limit how these variables can be changed. In foreach-loops, configured by the foreachReassign property: - deny: Report any reassignment of the loop variable in the loop body. _This is the default._ - allow: Don't check the loop variable. - firstOnly: Report any reassignments of the loop variable, except as the first statement in the loop body. _This is useful if some kind of normalization or clean-up of the value before using is permitted, but any other change of the variable is not._  In for-loops, configured by the forReassign property: - deny: Report any reassignment of the control variable in the loop body. _This is the default._ - allow: Don't check the control variable. - skip: Report any reassignments of the control variable, except conditional increments/decrements (++, --, +=, -=). _This prevents accidental reassignments or unconditional increments of the control variable._
