Excessive coupling to implementation types (e.g., HashSet) limits your ability to use alternate implementations in the future as requirements change. Whenever available, declare variables and parameters using a more general type (e.g, Set). This rule reports uses of concrete collection types. User-defined types that should be treated the same as interfaces can be configured with the property allowedTypes.
