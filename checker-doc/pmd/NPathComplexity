The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method. While cyclomatic complexity counts the number of decision points in a method, NPath counts the number of full paths from the beginning to the end of the block of the method. That metric grows exponentially, as it multiplies the complexity of statements in the same block.
