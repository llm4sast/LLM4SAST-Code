Non-thread safe singletons can result in bad state changes. Eliminate static singletons if possible by instantiating the object directly. Static singletons are usually not needed as only a single instance exists anyway. Other possible fixes are to synchronize the entire method or to use an initialize-on-demand holder class. Refrain from using the double-checked locking pattern. The Java Memory Model doesn't guarantee it to work unless the variable is declared as volatile, adding an uneeded performance penalty.
