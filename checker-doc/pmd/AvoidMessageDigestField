Declaring a MessageDigest instance as a field make this instance directly available to multiple threads. Such sharing of MessageDigest instances should be avoided if possible since it leads to wrong results if the access is not synchronized correctly. Just create a new instance and use it locally, where you need it. Creating a new instance is easier than synchronizing access to a shared instance.
