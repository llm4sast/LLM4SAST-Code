The rule will detect any test method starting with "test" that is not properly annotated, and will therefore not be run. In JUnit 4, only methods annotated with the @Test annotation are executed. In JUnit 5, one of the following annotations should be used for tests: @Test, @RepeatedTest, @TestFactory, @TestTemplate or @ParameterizedTest. In TestNG, only methods annotated with the @Test annotation are executed.
