Reports calls to overridable methods on this during object initialization. These are invoked on an incompletely constructed object and can be difficult to debug if overridden. This is because the subclass usually assumes that the superclass is completely initialized in all methods. If that is not the case, bugs can appear in the constructor, for instance, some fields that are still null may cause a NullPointerException or be stored somewhere else to blow up later. To avoid this problem, only use methods that are static, private, or final in constructors.
