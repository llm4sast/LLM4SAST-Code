This rule detects methods called tearDown() that are not properly annotated as a cleanup method. This is primarily intended to assist in upgrading from JUnit 3, where tear down methods were required to be called tearDown(). To a lesser extent, this may help detect omissions even under newer JUnit versions or under TestNG, as long as you are following this convention to name the methods. * JUnit 4 will only execute methods annotated with @After after running each test. * JUnit 5 introduced @AfterEach and @AfterAll annotations to execute methods after each test or after all tests in the class, respectively. * TestNG provides the annotations @AfterMethod and @AfterClass to execute methods after each test or after tests in the class, respectively.
