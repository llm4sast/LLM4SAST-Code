When switching over an enum or sealed class, the compiler will ensure that all possible cases are covered. If a case is missing, this will result in a compilation error. But if a default case is added, this compiler check is not performed anymore, leading to difficulties in noticing bugs at runtime. Not using a default case makes sure, a compiler error is introduced whenever a new enum constant or a new subclass to the sealed class hierarchy is added. We will discover this problem at compile time rather than at runtime (if at all).
