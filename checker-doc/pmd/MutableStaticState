Non-private static fields should be made constants (or immutable references) by declaring them final. Non-private non-final static fields break encapsulation and can lead to hard to find bugs, since these fields can be modified from anywhere within the program. Callers can trivially access and modify non-private non-final static fields. Neither accesses nor modifications can be guarded against, and newly set values cannot be validated.
