Fields in interfaces and annotations are automatically public static final, and methods are public abstract. Classes, interfaces or annotations nested in an interface or annotation are automatically public static (all nested interfaces and annotations are automatically static). Nested enums are automatically static. For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous.
