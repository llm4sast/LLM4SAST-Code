This rule detects methods called setUp() that are not properly annotated as a setup method. This is primarily intended to assist in upgrading from JUnit 3, where setup methods were required to be called setUp(). To a lesser extent, this may help detect omissions even under newer JUnit versions or under TestNG, as long as you are following this convention to name the methods. * JUnit 4 will only execute methods annotated with @Before before all tests. * JUnit 5 introduced @BeforeEach and @BeforeAll annotations to execute methods before each test or before all tests in the class, respectively. * TestNG provides the annotations @BeforeMethod and @BeforeClass to execute methods before each test or before tests in the class, respectively.
