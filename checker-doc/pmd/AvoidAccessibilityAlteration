Methods such as getDeclaredConstructors(), getDeclaredMethods(), and getDeclaredFields() also return private constructors, methods and fields. These can be made accessible by calling setAccessible(true). This gives access to normally protected data which violates the principle of encapsulation. This rule detects calls to setAccessible and finds possible accessibility alterations. If the call to setAccessible is wrapped within a PrivilegedAction, then the access alteration is assumed to be deliberate and is not reported.
