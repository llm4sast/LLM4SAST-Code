Test classes typically end with the suffix "Test", "Tests" or "TestCase". Having a non-test class with that name is not a good practice, since most people will assume it is a test case. Test classes have test methods named "testXXX" (JUnit3) or use annotations (e.g. @Test). The suffix can be configured using the property testClassPattern. To disable the detection of possible test classes by name, set this property to an empty string.
