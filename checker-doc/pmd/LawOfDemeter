The law of Demeter is a simple rule that says "only talk to friends". It forbids fetching data from "too far away", for some definition of distance, in order to reduce coupling between classes or objects of different levels of abstraction. The rule uses a notion of "degree", that quantifies how "far" an object is. Expressions with too high degree can only be used in certain ways. The degree of an expression is defined inductively: - The degree of this is 0 - The degree of a method parameter is 1 - The degree of a new object created in a method is 1 - The degree of a static variable is 1 - The degree of a field access expression like expr.field is the degree of expr plus 1 - The degree of a "getter expression" like expr.getFoo() is the degree of expr plus 1 - The degree of a "transformation expression" like expr.withFoo("") is the degree of expr - The degree of a variable is the maximum degree of all the assignments that reach it  Intuitively, the more you call getters, the more the degree increases. Eventually the degree reaches the report threshold (property trustRadius) and the expression is reported. The details of the calculation are more involved and make room for common patterns, like usage of collections (objects that are in a list or array have the same degree as their container), the builder pattern, and getters that do not appear to break a boundary of abstraction. Be aware that this rule is prone to many false-positives and low-priority warnings. You can increase the trustRadius property to reduce them drastically. The default trustRadius of 1 corresponds to the original law of Demeter (you're only allowed one getter call on untrusted values). Given some trustRadius value: - expressions of degree lower or equal to trustRadius are not reported - expressions of degree exactly trustRadius + 1 are reported, unless they are only returned from the current method, or passed as argument to another method. Without this exception it would not be possible to extract any information from e.g. method parameters. - values of degree strictly greater than trustRadius + 1 are not reported. The intuition is that to obtain a value of degree n > 1 then you must use an expression of degree n - 1, so if you have n > trustRadius + 1, there you're using some value of degree trustRadius + 1 that will be reported.
