Configurable naming conventions for type declarations. This rule reports type declarations which do not match the regex that applies to their specific kind (e.g. enum or interface). Each regex can be configured through properties. By default, this rule uses the standard Java naming convention (Pascal case). The rule can detect utility classes and enforce a different naming convention on those. E.g. setting the property utilityClassPattern to [A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]+(Utils?|Helper|Constants) reports any utility class, whose name does not end in "Util(s)", "Helper" or "Constants". For this rule, a utility class is defined as: a concrete class that does not inherit from a super class or implement any interface and only has static fields or methods. This rule detects test classes using the following convention: Test classes are top-level classes, that either inherit from JUnit 3 TestCase or have at least one method annotated with the Test annotations from JUnit4/5 or TestNG.
