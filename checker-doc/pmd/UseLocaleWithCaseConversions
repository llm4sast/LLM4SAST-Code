When doing String::toLowerCase()/toUpperCase() conversions, use an explicit locale argument to specify the case transformation rules. Using String::toLowerCase() without arguments implicitly uses Locale::getDefault(). The problem is that the default locale depends on the current JVM setup (and usually on the system in which it is running). Using the system default may be exactly what you want (e.g. if you are manipulating strings you got through standard input), but it may as well not be the case (e.g. if you are getting the string over the network or a file, and the encoding is well-defined and independent of the environment). In the latter case, using the default locale makes the case transformation brittle, as it may yield unexpected results on a machine whose locale has other case translation rules.
