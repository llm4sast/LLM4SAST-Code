String.trim().length() == 0 (or String.trim().isEmpty() for the same reason) is an inefficient way to check if a String is really blank, as it creates a new String object just to check its size. Consider creating a static function that loops through a string, checking Character.isWhitespace() on each character and returning false if a non-whitespace character is found.
