Double brace initialisation is a pattern to initialise eg collections concisely. But it implicitly generates a new .class file, and the object holds a strong reference to the enclosing object. For those reasons, it is preferable to initialize the object normally, even though it's verbose. This rule counts any anonymous class which only has a single initializer as an instance of double-brace initialization. There is currently no way to find out whether a method called in the initializer is not accessible from outside the anonymous class, and those legit cases should be suppressed for the time being.
