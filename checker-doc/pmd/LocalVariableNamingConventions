Configurable naming conventions for local variable declarations and other locally-scoped variables. This rule reports variable declarations which do not match the regex that applies to their specific kind (e.g. final variable, or catch-clause parameter). Each regex can be configured through properties. By default this rule uses the standard Java naming convention (Camel case).
