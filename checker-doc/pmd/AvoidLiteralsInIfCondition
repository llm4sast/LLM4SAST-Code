Avoid using hard-coded literals in conditional statements. By declaring them as static variables or private members with descriptive names maintainability is enhanced. By default, the literals "-1" and "0" are ignored. More exceptions can be defined with the property "ignoreMagicNumbers". The rule doesn't consider deeper expressions by default, but this can be enabled via the property ignoreExpressions. With this property set to false, if-conditions like i == 1 + 5 are reported as well.
