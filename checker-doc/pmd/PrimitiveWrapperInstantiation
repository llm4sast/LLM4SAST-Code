Reports usages of primitive wrapper constructors. They are deprecated since Java 9 and should not be used. Even before Java 9, they can be replaced with usage of the corresponding static valueOf factory method (which may be automatically inserted by the compiler since Java 1.5). This has the advantage that it may reuse common instances instead of creating a new instance each time.
