An operation on an immutable object will not change the object itself since the result of the operation is a new object. Therefore, ignoring the result of such an operation is likely a mistake. The operation can probably be removed. This rule recognizes the types String, BigDecimal, BigInteger or any type from java.time.* as immutable.
