Configurable naming conventions for field declarations. This rule reports variable declarations which do not match the regex that applies to their specific kind ---e.g. constants (static final), enum constant, final field. Each regex can be configured through properties. By default this rule uses the standard Java naming convention (Camel case), and uses the ALL_UPPER convention for constants and enum constants.
