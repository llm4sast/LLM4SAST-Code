An iteration on a Collection should be performed on the type handled by the Collection
When iterating over an Iterable with a for loop, the iteration variable could have the same type as the type returned by the iterator (the item type of the Iterable ). This rule reports when a supertype of the item type is used for the variable instead, but the variable is then explicitly downcast in the loop body. Using explicit type casts instead of leveraging the language’s type system is a bad practice. It disables static type checking by the compiler for the cast expressions, but potential errors will throw a ClassCastException during runtime instead.
