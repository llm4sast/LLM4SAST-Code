"@Controller" should be replaced with "@RestController"
Classes annotated as @Controller in Spring are responsible for handling incoming web requests. When annotating methods or the entire controller with @ResponseBody, the return value of said methods will be serialized and set as the response body. In other words, it tells the Spring framework that this method does not produce a view. This mechanism is commonly used to create API endpoints. Spring provides @RestController as a convenient annotation to replace the combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody. The two are functionally identical, so the single annotation approach is preferred. This rule will raise an issue on a class that is annotated with @Controller if: the class is also annotated with @ResponseBody or all methods in said class are annotated with @ResponseBody.
