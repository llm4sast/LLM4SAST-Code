Use switch instead of if-else chain to compare a variable against multiple cases
Comparing a variable to multiple cases is a frequent operation. This can be done using a sequence of if-else statements. However, for many cases like enums or simple value comparisons, a switch statement is the better alternative. With Java 21, the switch statement has been significantly improved to support pattern matching and record pattern. Using a switch statement instead of an if-else chain provides benefits like clearer code, certainty of covering all cases, and may even improve performance.
