TestCases should contain tests
There’s no point in having a JUnit TestCase without any test methods. Similarly, you shouldn’t have a file in the tests directory named *Test, *Tests, or *TestCase, but no tests in the file. Doing either of these things may lead someone to think that uncovered classes have been tested.
