Server-side templates should not be vulnerable to injection attacks
Server-side template injections occur when an application retrieves data from a user or a third-party service and inserts it into a template, without sanitizing it first. If an application contains a template that is vulnerable to injections, it is exposed to attacks that target the underlying rendering server. A user with malicious intent can create requests that will cause the template to change its logic into unwanted behavior. What is the potential impact? An attacker exploiting a server-side template injection vulnerability will be able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. The impact depends on the access control measures taken on the target system OS. In the worst-case scenario, the process runs with root privileges, and therefore any OS commands or programs may be affected. Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability. Denial of service and data leaks In this scenario, the attack aims to disrupt the organization’s activities and profit from data leaks. An attacker could, for example: download the internal server’s data, most likely to sell it modify data, send malware stop services or exhaust resources (with fork bombs for example) This threat is particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP). Root privilege escalation and pivot In this scenario, the attacker can do everything described in the previous section. The difference is that the attacker also manages to elevate their privileges to an administrative level and attacks other servers. Here, the impact depends on how much the target company focuses on its Defense In Depth.
