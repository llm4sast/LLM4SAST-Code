Regex patterns should not be created needlessly
The java.util.regex.Pattern.compile() methods have a significant performance cost, and therefore should be used sensibly. Moreover they are the only mechanism available to create instances of the Pattern class, which are necessary to do any pattern matching using regular expressions. Unfortunately that can be hidden behind convenience methods like String.matches() or String.split(). It is therefore somewhat easy to inadvertently repeatedly compile the same regular expression at great performance cost with no valid reason.
