JUnit rules should be used
JUnit rules are predefined classes that extend the behavior of JUnit tests, allowing to add new functionalities, such as managing resources, modifying test behavior, and handling exceptions. Unused JUnit rules can lead to confusion when reading the test code, making tests harder to understand and maintain. Having unused rules can also slow down the test suite, as JUnit has to process the rules even though they are not being used. Some TestRule classes have the desired effect without being directly referenced by a test, while others do not. There’s no reason to leave them cluttering the file if they’re not in use.
