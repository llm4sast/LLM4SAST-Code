Exceptions should not be thrown from servlet methods
Servlets are components in Java web development, responsible for processing HTTP requests and generating responses. In this context, exceptions are used to handle and manage unexpected errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during the execution of a servlet. Catching exceptions within the servlet allows us to convert them into meaningful, user-friendly messages. Otherwise, failing to catch exceptions will propagate them to the servlet container, where the default error-handling mechanism may impact the overall security and stability of the server.
