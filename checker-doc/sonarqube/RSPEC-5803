Class members annotated with "@VisibleForTesting" should not be accessed from production code
@VisibleForTesting can be used to mark methods, fields and classes whose visibility restrictions have been relaxed more than necessary for the API to allow for easier unit testing. Access to such methods, fields and classes only possible thanks to this relaxed visibility is fine for test code, but it should be avoided in production code.
