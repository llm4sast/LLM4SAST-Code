Whitespace and control characters in literals should be explicit
Non-encoded control characters and whitespace characters are often injected in the source code because of a bad manipulation. They are either invisible or difficult to recognize, which can result in bugs when the string is not what the developer expects. If you actually need to use a control character use their encoded version (ex: ASCII \n,\t, …​ or Unicode U+000D, U+0009, …​).
