Collection methods with O(n) performance should be used carefully
The time complexity of method calls on collections is not always obvious. For instance, for most collections the size() method takes constant time, but the time required to execute ConcurrentLinkedQueue.size() is O(n), i.e. directly proportional to the number of elements in the collection. When the collection is large, this could therefore be an expensive operation.
