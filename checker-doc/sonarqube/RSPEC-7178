Injecting data into static fields is not supported by Spring
Spring dependency injection framework does not support injecting data into static fields. When @Value, @Inject, or @Autowired are applied to static fields, they are ignored. What is the potential impact? Null Values : Uninitialized static fields annotated with @Value, @Inject, or @Autowired will not be initialized by Spring, potentially causing NullPointerException at runtime. Confusing Code : The presence of injection annotations on static fields can mislead developers into believing that the fields will be populated by Spring.
