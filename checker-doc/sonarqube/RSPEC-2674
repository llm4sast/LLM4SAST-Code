The value returned from a stream read should be checked
You cannot assume that any given stream reading call will fill the byte[] passed in to the method. Instead, you must check the value returned by the read method to see how many bytes were read. Fail to do so, and you introduce bug that is both harmful and difficult to reproduce. Similarly, you cannot assume that InputStream.skip will actually skip the requested number of bytes, but must check the value returned from the method.
