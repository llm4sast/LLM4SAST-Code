Methods with Spring proxying annotations should be public
Marking a non-public method @Async or @Transactional is misleading because Spring does not recognize non-public methods, and so makes no provision for their proper invocation. Nor does Spring make provision for the methods invoked by the method it called. Therefore marking a private method, for instance, @Transactional can only result in a runtime error or exception if the method is annotated as @Transactional.
