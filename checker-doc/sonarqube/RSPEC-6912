Use batch Processing in JDBC
Executing a batch of SQL queries instead of individual queries improves performance by reducing communication overhead with the database. Batching SQL statements is beneficial in common situations where a SQL statement is executed within a loop. In such cases, adding the statement to a batch and subsequently executing it reduces the number of interactions with the database. This results in improved efficiency and faster execution times. The rule raises an issue when it detects a java.sql.Statement being executed within a loop instruction, such as for, while or the forEach method of java.lang.Iterable, java.util.Map and java.util.stream.Stream.
