Classes extending java.lang.Thread should provide a specific "run" behavior
The default implementation of java.lang.Thread's run will only perform a task passed as a Runnable. If no Runnable has been provided at construction time, then the thread will not perform any action. When extending java.lang.Thread, you should override the run method or pass a Runnable target to the constructor of java.lang.Thread.
