Lambdas should be replaced with method references
Method or constructor references are more readable than lambda expressions in many situations, and may therefore be preferred. However, method references are sometimes less concise than lambdas. In such cases, it might be preferrable to keep the lambda expression for better readability. Therefore, this rule only raises issues on lambda expressions where the replacement method reference is shorter. This rule is automatically disabled when the project’s sonar.java.source is lower than 8, as lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8.
