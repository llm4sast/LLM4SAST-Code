Zero should not be a possible denominator
If the denominator to an integer division or remainder operation is zero, a ArithmeticException is thrown. This error will crash your program in most cases. To fix it, you need to ensure that the denominator value in all division operations is always non-zero, or check the value against zero before performing the division.
