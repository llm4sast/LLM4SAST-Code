Try-with-resources should be used
Many resources in Java need be closed after they have been used. If they are not, the garbage collector cannot reclaim the resources' memory, and they are still considered to be in use by the operating system. Such resources are considered to be leaked, which can lead to performance issues. Java 7 introduced the try-with-resources statement, which guarantees that the resource in question will be closed. try (InputStream input = Files.newInputStream(path)) { // "input" will be closed after the execution of this block } This syntax is safer than the traditional method using try, catch, and finally and hence should be preferred.
