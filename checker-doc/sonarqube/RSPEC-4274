Asserts should not be used to check the parameters of a public method
An assert is inappropriate for parameter validation because assertions can be disabled at runtime in the JVM, meaning that a bad operational setting would completely eliminate the intended checks. Further, assert s that fail throw AssertionError s, rather than throwing some type of Exception. Throwing Error s is completely outside of the normal realm of expected catch / throw behavior in normal programs.
