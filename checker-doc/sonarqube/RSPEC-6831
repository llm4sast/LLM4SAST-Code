"@Qualifier" should not be used on "@Bean" methods
In Spring Framework, the @Qualifier annotation is typically used to disambiguate between multiple beans of the same type when auto-wiring dependencies. It is not necessary to use @Qualifier when defining a bean using the @Bean annotation because the bean’s name can be explicitly specified using the name attribute or derived from the method name. Using @Qualifier on @Bean methods can lead to confusion and redundancy. Beans should be named appropriately using either the name attribute of the @Bean annotation or the method name itself.
