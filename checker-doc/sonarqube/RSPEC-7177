Use appropriate @DirtiesContext modes
In a Spring application, the @DirtiesContext annotation marks the ApplicationContext as dirty and indicates that it should be cleared and recreated. This is important in tests that modify the context, such as altering the state of singleton beans or databases. Misconfiguring @DirtiesContext by setting the methodMode at the class level or the classMode at the method level will make the annotation have no effect. This rule will raise an issue when the incorrect mode is configured on a @DirtiesContext annotation targeting a different scope.
