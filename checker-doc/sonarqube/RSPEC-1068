Unused "private" fields should be removed
If a private field is declared but not used locally, its limited visibility makes it dead code. This is either a sign that some logic is missing or that the code should be cleaned. Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand and preventing bugs from being introduced. public class MyClass { private int foo = 42; // Noncompliant: foo is unused and should be removed public int compute(int a) { return a * 42; } } Note that this rule does not take reflection into account, which means that issues will be raised on private fields that are only accessed using the reflection API.
