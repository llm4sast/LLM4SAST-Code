Using pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) is security-sensitive
PRNGs are algorithms that produce sequences of numbers that only approximate true randomness. While they are suitable for applications like simulations or modeling, they are not appropriate for security-sensitive contexts because their outputs can be predictable if the internal state is known. In contrast, cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) are designed to be secure against prediction attacks. CSPRNGs use cryptographic algorithms to ensure that the generated sequences are not only random but also unpredictable, even if part of the sequence or the internal state becomes known. This unpredictability is crucial for security-related tasks such as generating encryption keys, tokens, or any other values that must remain confidential and resistant to guessing attacks.
