Methods should not call same-class methods with incompatible "@Transactional" values
Transactional methods have a propagation type parameter in the @Transaction annotation that specifies the requirements about the transactional context in which the method can be called and how it creates, appends, or suspends an ongoing transaction. When an instance that contains transactional methods is injected, Spring uses proxy objects to wrap these methods with the actual transaction code. However, if a transactional method is called from another method in the same class, the this argument is used as the receiver instance instead of the injected proxy object, which bypasses the wrapper code.
