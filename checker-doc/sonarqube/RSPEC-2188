JUnit test cases should call super methods
Overriding a parent class method prevents that method from being called unless an explicit super call is made in the overriding method. In some cases, not calling the parent method is fine. However, setUp and tearDown provide some shared logic that is called before all test cases. This logic may change over the lifetime of your codebase. To make sure that your test cases are set up and cleaned up consistently, your overriding implementations of setUp and tearDown should call the parent implementations explicitly.
