Processing persistent unique identifiers is security-sensitive
Mobile devices expose unique identifiers that can be used to identify users across applications or devices. These identifiers put user privacy at risk, as they might allow the tracking of user activity without consent, while making it difficult or impossible for users to reset them. Privacy violations can cause apps to be removed from app stores and can result in legal action or loss of trust from users. Ask Yourself Whether The identifier is used to track users between applications or devices. The identifier cannot be easily reset by the user. The identifier is connected to personally identifiable information. The identifier is linked to the device hardware (MAC address, IMEI, etc). There is a risk if you answer yes to any of these questions.
