Similar tests should be grouped in a single Parameterized test
When multiple tests differ only by a few hardcoded values they should be refactored as a single "parameterized" test. This reduces the chances of adding a bug and makes them more readable. Parameterized tests exist in most test frameworks (JUnit, TestNG, etc…​). The right balance needs of course to be found. There is no point in factorizing test methods when the parameterized version is a lot more complex than initial tests.
