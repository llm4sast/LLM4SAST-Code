AssertJ assertions "allMatch" and "doesNotContains" should also test for emptiness
AssertJ assertions allMatch and doesNotContains on an empty list always returns true whatever the content of the predicate. Despite being correct, you should make explicit if you expect an empty list or not, by adding isEmpty() / isNotEmpty() in addition to calling the assertion, or by testing the list’s content further. It will justify the useless predicate to improve clarity or increase the reliability of the test.
