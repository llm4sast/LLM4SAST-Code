Tests should be stable
Unstable / flaky tests are tests which sometimes pass and sometimes fail, without any code change. Obviously, they slow down developments when developers have to rerun failed tests. However, the real problem is that you can’t completely trust these tests, they might fail for many different reasons and you don’t know if any of them will happen in production. Some tools, such as TestNG, enable developers to automatically retry flaky tests. This might be acceptable as a temporary solution, but it should eventually be fixed. The more flaky tests you add, the more chances there are for a bug to arrive in production.
