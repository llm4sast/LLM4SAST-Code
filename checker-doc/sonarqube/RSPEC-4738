Java features should be preferred to Guava
Some Guava features were really useful for Java 7 application because Guava was bringing APIs missing in the JDK. Java 8 fixed some of these limitations. When migrating an application to Java 8 or even when starting a new one, it’s recommended to prefer Java 8 APIs over Guava ones to ease its maintenance: developers don’t need to learn how to use two APIs and can stick to the standard one. Java 9 brought even more useful methods to the standard Java library and if Java version is equal to or higher than 9, these standard methods should be used.
