Lazy initialization of "static" fields should be "synchronized"
In a multi-threaded situation, un- synchronized lazy initialization of static fields could mean that a second thread has access to a half-initialized object while the first thread is still creating it. Allowing such access could cause serious bugs. Instead. the initialization block should be synchronized. Similarly, updates of such fields should also be synchronized.
