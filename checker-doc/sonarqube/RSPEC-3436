Value-based classes should not be used for locking
According to the documentation, A program may produce unpredictable results if it attempts to distinguish two references to equal values of a value-based class, whether directly via reference equality or indirectly via an appeal to synchronization…​ This is because value-based classes are intended to be wrappers for value types, which will be primitive-like collections of data (similar to struct s in other languages) that will come in future versions of Java. Instances of a value-based class …​ do not have accessible constructors, but are instead instantiated through factory methods which make no commitment as to the identity of returned instances; This means that you can’t be sure you’re the only one trying to lock on any given instance of a value-based class, opening your code up to contention and deadlock issues. Under Java 8 breaking this rule may not actually break your code, but there are no guarantees of the behavior beyond that.
