Reflection should not be used to increase accessibility of records' fields
In general, altering or bypassing the accessibility of classes, methods, or fields violates the encapsulation principle and could lead to runtime errors. For records the case is even trickier: you cannot change the visibility of records’s fields and trying to update the existing value will lead to IllegalAccessException at runtime.
