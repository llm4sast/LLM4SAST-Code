"ResultSet.isLast()" should not be used
There are several reasons to avoid using this method: It is optionally available only for result sets of type ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY. Database drivers will throw an exception if not supported. The method can be expensive to execute as the database driver may need to fetch ahead one row to determine whether the current row is the last in the result set. The documentation of the method explicitly mentions this fact. What "the cursor is on the last row" means for an empty ResultSet is unclear. Database drivers may return true or false in this case. ResultSet.next() is a good alternative to ResultSet.isLast() as it does not have the mentioned issues. It is always supported and, as per specification, returns false for empty result sets.
