Future keywords should not be used as names
Programming languages evolve over time, and new versions of Java introduce additional keywords. If future keywords are used in the current code, it can create compatibility issues when transitioning to newer versions of Java. The code may fail to compile or behave unexpectedly due to conflicts with newly introduced keywords. The _ keyword was deprecated in Java 9 and disallowed since Java 11. Starting from Java 22 the _ was introduced as unnamed variable. This rule reports an issue when _ is used in versions prior to Java 22.
