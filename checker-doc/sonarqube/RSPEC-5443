Using publicly writable directories is security-sensitive
Operating systems have global directories where any user has write access. Those folders are mostly used as temporary storage areas like /tmp in Linux based systems. An application manipulating files from these folders is exposed to race conditions on filenames: a malicious user can try to create a file with a predictable name before the application does. A successful attack can result in other files being accessed, modified, corrupted or deleted. This risk is even higher if the application runs with elevated permissions.
