Proper Sensor Resource Management
Optimizing resource usage and preventing unnecessary battery drain are critical considerations in Android development. Failing to release sensor resources when they are no longer needed can lead to prolonged device activity, negatively impacting battery life. Common Android sensors, such as cameras, GPS, and microphones, provide a method to release resources after they are not in use anymore. This rule identifies situations where a sensor is not released after being utilized, helping developers maintain efficient and battery-friendly applications.
