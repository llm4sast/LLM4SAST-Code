Environment variables should not be defined from untrusted input
Environment variable injection occurs in an application when the application receives data from a user or a third-party service and, without sanitizing it first, does the following: Creates an environment variable based on the external data. Inserts the external data into certain sensitive environment variables, such as PATH or LD_PRELOAD. If an application uses environment variables that are vulnerable to injection, it is exposed to a variety of attacks that aim to exploit supposedly safe environment variables, such as `PATH`. A user with malicious intent carefully performs actions aimed at modifying or adding environment variables to profit from it. What is the potential impact? When user-supplied values are used to manipulate environment variables, an attacker can supply carefully chosen values that cause the system to behave unexpectedly. In some cases, the attacker can use this capability to execute arbitrary code on the server. Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability. Application-specific attacks In this scenario, the attacker manages to inject an environment variable that is recognized and used by the remote system.
