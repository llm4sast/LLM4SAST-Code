"Integer.toHexString" should not be used to build hexadecimal strings
Using Integer.toHexString is a common mistake when converting sequences of bytes into hexadecimal string representations. The problem is that the method trims leading zeroes, which can lead to wrong conversions. For instance a two bytes value of 0x4508 would be converted into 45 and 8 which once concatenated would give 0x458. This is particularly damaging when converting hash-codes and could lead to a security vulnerability.
