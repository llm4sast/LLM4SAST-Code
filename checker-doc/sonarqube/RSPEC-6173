Reflection should not be vulnerable to injection attacks
Reflection injections occur in a web application when it retrieves data from a user or a third-party service and fully or partially uses it to inspect, load or invoke a component by name. If an application uses a reflection method in a way that is vulnerable to injections, it is exposed to attacks that aim to achieve remote code execution on the server’s website. A user with malicious intent exploits this by carefully crafting a string involving symbols such as class methods, that will help them change the initial reflection logic to an impactful malicious one. After creating the malicious request and triggering it, the attacker can attack the servers affected by this vulnerability without relying on any pre-requisites. What is the potential impact? If user-supplied values are used to choose which code is executed, an attacker may be able to supply carefully-chosen values that cause unexpected code to run. The attacker can use this ability to run arbitrary code on the server. Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability. Application-specific attacks In this scenario, the attackers succeed in injecting a seemingly-legitimate object, but whose properties might be used maliciously. Depending on the application, attackers might be able to modify important data structures or content to escalate privileges or perform unwanted actions.
