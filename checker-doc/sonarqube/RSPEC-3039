Indexes to passed to "String" operations should be within the string's bounds
There are various String operations that take one or more character indexes as arguments and return a portion of the original string. Indexing in this context is zero-based, meaning that the first character’s index is 0. As a result, given a string myString, its last character is at index myString.length() - 1. The String operation methods throw a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when one of their index argument is smaller than 0 (E.G.: -1). String::substring also throws this exception when the beginIndex or endIndex argument is larger than myString.length(), and String::charAt when the index argument is larger than myString.length() - 1 For instance, it is not possible to use String::charAt to retrieve a value before the start or after the end of a string. Furthermore, it is not possible to use String::substring with beginIndex > endIndex to reverse the order of characters in a string.
