"@Cache*" annotations should only be applied on concrete classes
Annotating interfaces or interface methods with @Cache* annotations is not recommended by the official Spring documentation: Spring recommends that you only annotate concrete classes (and methods of concrete classes) with the @Cache* annotations, as opposed to annotating interfaces. You certainly can place an @Cache* annotation on an interface (or an interface method), but this works only if you use the proxy mode (mode="proxy"). If you use the weaving-based aspect (mode="aspectj"), the caching settings are not recognized on interface-level declarations by the weaving infrastructure. Also, when a method is annotated as cacheable inside an interface, if two different implementations of that method exist, the first one to be invoked will populate the cache. Subsequent calls will always return the cached value, even if it’s the other implementation being called.
