Regular expressions should not overflow the stack
The Java regex engine uses recursive method calls to implement backtracking. Therefore when a repetition inside a regular expression contains multiple paths (i.e. the body of the repetition contains an alternation ( | ), an optional element or another repetition), trying to match the regular expression can cause a stack overflow on large inputs. This does not happen when using a possessive quantifier (such as *+ instead of * ) or when using a character class inside a repetition (e.g. [ab]* instead of (a|b)* ). The size of the input required to overflow the stack depends on various factors, including of course the stack size of the JVM. One thing that significantly increases the size of the input that can be processed is if each iteration of the repetition goes through a chain of multiple constant characters because such consecutive characters will be matched by the regex engine without invoking any recursion.
