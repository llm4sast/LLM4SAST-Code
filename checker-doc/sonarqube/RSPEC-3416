Loggers should be named for their enclosing classes
It is convention to name each class’s logger for the class itself. Doing so allows you to set up clear, communicative logger configuration. Naming loggers by some other convention confuses configuration, and using the same class name for multiple class loggers prevents the granular configuration of each class' logger. Some libraries, such as SLF4J warn about this, but not all do.
