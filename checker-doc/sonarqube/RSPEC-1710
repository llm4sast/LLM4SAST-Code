Annotation repetitions should not be wrapped
Before Java 8, a container annotation was required as wrapper to use multiple instances of the same annotation. As of Java 8, this is no longer necessary. Instead, these annotations should be used directly without a wrapper, resulting in cleaner and more readable code. This rule is automatically disabled when the project’s sonar.java.source is lower than 8 as repeating annotations were introduced in Java 8.
