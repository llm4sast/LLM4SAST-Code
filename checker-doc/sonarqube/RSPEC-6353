Regular expression quantifiers and character classes should be used concisely
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a match pattern in text. Among the most important concepts are: Character classes: defines a set of characters, any one of which can occur in an input string for a match to succeed. Quantifiers: used to specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match. Wildcard (. ): matches all characters except line terminators (also matches them if the s flag is set). Many of these features include shortcuts of widely used expressions, so there is more than one way to construct a regular expression to achieve the same results.
