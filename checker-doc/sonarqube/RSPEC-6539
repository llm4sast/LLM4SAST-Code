Classes should not depend on an excessive number of classes (aka Monster Class)
"Monster Class" is a class that implements too many functionalities that are not well organized, or cohesive. Monster Classes are not created intentionally, but rather they often arise over time as a result of poor software design or a lack of attention to good programming practices such as modularization and encapsulation. As a software evolves and new requirements are added, it can be tempting to add new functionality to existing classes rather than creating new classes to handle the new functionality. This leads to classes becoming bloated and difficult to understand and maintain, ultimately resulting in a Monster Class. Here are the characteristics of a Monster Class: High number of instance variables and methods Variables and methods that are not related to each other (low cohesion and high coupling) Too many responsibilities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle (aka SRP) Difficult to test, leading to poor test coverage and a higher risk of defects.
