Chained AssertJ assertions should be simplified to the corresponding dedicated assertion
AssertJ contains many assertions methods specific to common types. Both versions will test the same things, but the dedicated one will provide a better error message, simplifying the debugging process. This rule reports an issue when an assertion can be simplified to a dedicated one. The array below gives a non-exhaustive list of assertion reported by the rule. Code behaving similarly, or with a negation will also be reported.
