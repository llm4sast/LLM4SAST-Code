"@Autowired" should only be used on a single constructor
@Autowired is an annotation in the Spring Framework for automatic dependency injection. It tells Spring to automatically provide the required dependencies (such as other beans or components) to a class’s fields, methods, or constructors, allowing for easier and more flexible management of dependencies in a Spring application. In other words, it’s a way to wire up and inject dependencies into Spring components automatically, reducing the need for manual configuration and enhancing modularity and maintainability. In any bean class, only one constructor is permitted to declare @Autowired with the required attribute set to true. This signifies the constructor to be automatically wired when used as a Spring bean. Consequently, when the required attribute remains at its default value (true), only a singular constructor can bear the @Autowired annotation. In cases where multiple constructors have this annotation, they must all specify required=false to be eligible as candidates for auto-wiring.
