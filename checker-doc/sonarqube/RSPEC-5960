Assertions should not be used in production code
Assertions are intended to be used in test code, but not in production code. It is confusing, and might lead to ClassNotFoundException when the build tools only provide the required dependency in test scope. In addition, assertions will throw a sub-class of Error: AssertionError, which should be avoided in production code.
