Inappropriate "Collection" calls should not be made
The java.util.Collection type and its subtypes provide methods to access and modify collections such as Collection.remove(Object o) and Collection.contains(Object o). Some of these methods accept arguments of type java.lang.Object and will compare said argument with objects already in the collection. If the actual type of the argument is unrelated to the type of object contained in the collection, these methods will always return false, null, or -1. This behavior is most likely unintended and can be indicative of a design issue.
