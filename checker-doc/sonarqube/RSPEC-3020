"Collection.toArray()" should be passed an array of the proper type
The Collection.toArray() method returns an Object[] when no arguments are provided to it. This can lead to a ClassCastException at runtime if you try to cast the returned array to an array of a specific type. Instead, use this method by providing an array of the desired type as the argument. Note that passing a new T[0] array of length zero as the argument is more efficient than a pre-sized array new T[size].
