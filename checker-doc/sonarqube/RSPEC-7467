Unused exception parameter should use the unnamed variable pattern
Good exception management is key to keeping a consistent application state in the face of errors and unexpected behaviors. However, in some cases, the information carried by the exception is not as important as the exception bubbling up itself. In such cases, developers may want to explicitly indicate that they have no use for the exception parameter. Java 22 introduces the unnamed variable pattern _ which allows developers to free the catch clause from an unnecessary exception parameter name.
