"ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor" should not have 0 core threads
ThreadPoolExecutor is an object that efficiently manages and controls the execution of multiple tasks in a thread pool. A thread pool is a collection of pre-initialized threads ready to execute tasks. Instead of creating a new thread for each task, which can be costly in terms of system resources, a thread pool reuses existing threads. java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor is an extension of ThreadPoolExecutor that can additionally schedule commands to run after a given delay or to execute periodically. ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor's pool is sized with corePoolSize, so setting corePoolSize to zero means the executor will have no threads and run nothing. corePoolSize should have a value greater than zero and valid for your tasks. This rule detects instances where corePoolSize is set to zero via its setter or the object constructor.
