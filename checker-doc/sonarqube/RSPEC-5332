Using clear-text protocols is security-sensitive
Clear-text protocols such as ftp, telnet, or http lack encryption of transported data, as well as the capability to build an authenticated connection. It means that an attacker able to sniff traffic from the network can read, modify, or corrupt the transported content. These protocols are not secure as they expose applications to an extensive range of risks: sensitive data exposure traffic redirected to a malicious endpoint malware-infected software update or installer execution of client-side code corruption of critical information Even in the context of isolated networks like offline environments or segmented cloud environments, the insider threat exists. Thus, attacks involving communications being sniffed or tampered with can still happen.
