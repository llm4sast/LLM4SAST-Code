JUnit4 @Ignored and JUnit5 @Disabled annotations should be used to disable tests and should provide a rationale
When a test fails due, for example, to infrastructure issues, you might want to ignore it temporarily. But without some kind of notation about why the test is being ignored, it may never be reactivated. Such tests are difficult to address without comprehensive knowledge of the project, and end up polluting their projects.
