Generic wildcard types should not be used in return types
A return type containing wildcards cannot be narrowed down in any context. This indicates that the developer’s intention was likely something else. The core problem lies in type variance. Expressions at an input position, such as arguments passed to a method, can have a more specific type than the type expected by the method, which is called covariance. Expressions at an output position, such as a variable that receives the return result from a method, can have a more general type than the method’s return type, which is called contravariance. This can be traced back to the Liskov substitution principle. In Java, type parameters of a generic type are invariant by default due to their potential occurrence in both input and output positions at the same time.
