Map values should not be replaced unconditionally
Storing a value inside a collection at a given key or index and then unconditionally overwriting it without reading the initial value is a case of a "dead store". letters.put("a", "Apple"); letters.put("a", "Boy"); // Noncompliant towns[i] = "London"; towns[i] = "Chicago"; // Noncompliant This practice is redundant and will cause confusion for the reader. More importantly, it is often an error and not what the developer intended to do.
