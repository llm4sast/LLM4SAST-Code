Exposing Java objects through JavaScript interfaces is security-sensitive
Using JavaScript interfaces in WebViews to expose Java objects is unsafe. Doing so allows JavaScript to invoke Java methods, potentially giving attackers access to data or sensitive app functionality. WebViews might include untrusted sources such as third-party iframes, making this functionality particularly risky. As JavaScript interfaces are passed to every frame in the WebView, those iframes are also able to access the exposed Java object. Ask Yourself Whether The content in the WebView is fully trusted and secure. Potentially untrusted iframes could be loaded in the WebView. The JavaScript interface has to be exposed for the entire lifecycle of the WebView. The exposed Java object might be called by untrusted sources. There is a risk if you answered yes to any of these questions. Recommended Secure Coding Practices Disable JavaScript If it is possible to disable JavaScript in the WebView, this is the most secure option. By default, JavaScript is disabled in a WebView, so webSettings.setJavaScriptEnabled(false) does not need to be explicitly called. Of course, sometimes it is necessary to enable JavaScript, in which case the following recommendations should be considered. Remove JavaScript interface when loading untrusted content JavaScript interfaces can be removed at a later point. It is recommended to remove the JavaScript interface when it is no longer needed. If it is needed for a longer time, consider removing it before loading untrusted content. This can be done by calling webView.removeJavascriptInterface("interfaceName"). A good place to do this is inside the shouldInterceptRequest method of a WebViewClient, where you can check the URL or resource being loaded and remove the interface if the content is untrusted. Alternative methods to implement native bridges If a native bridge has to be added to the WebView, and it is impossible to remove it at a later point, consider using an alternative method that offers more control over the communication flow. WebViewCompat.postWebMessage / WebViewCompat.addWebMessageListener and WebMessagePort.postMessage offer more ways to validate incoming and outgoing messages, such as by being able to restrict the origins that can send messages to the JavaScript bridge.
