The Singleton design pattern should be used with care
The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern. It ensures that only one class instance is created and provides a global point of access to it. There are several ways to implement a Singleton in Java, and the debate about the best approach has yet to be settled. This rule marks all classes that are considered as Singletons, regardless of how they are implemented. This helps developers identify where in the code Singletons are used. Singletons should be reviewed to confirm whether a Singleton is truly necessary and whether the selected implementation is the most suitable for the context. Every Singleton implementation has its advantages and disadvantages. This rule exists to bring attention to them so that informed decisions can be made.
