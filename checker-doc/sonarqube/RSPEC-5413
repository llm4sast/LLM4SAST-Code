'List.remove()' should not be used in ascending 'for' loops
When List.remove() is called, the list shrinks, and the indices of all elements following the removed element are decremented by one. If this operation is performed within a loop that iterates through the elements in ascending order, it will cause the loop to skip the element immediately following the removed element.
