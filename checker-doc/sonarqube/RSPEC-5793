Migrate your tests from JUnit4 to the new JUnit5 annotations
As mentioned in JUnit5 documentation, it is possible to integrate JUnit4 with JUnit5: JUnit provides a gentle migration path via a JUnit Vintage test engine which allows existing tests based on JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 to be executed using the JUnit Platform infrastructure. Since all classes and annotations specific to JUnit Jupiter reside under a new org.junit.jupiter base package, having both JUnit 4 and JUnit Jupiter in the classpath does not lead to any conflicts. However, maintaining both systems is a temporary solution. This rule flags all the annotations from JUnit4 which would need to be migrated to JUnit5, hence helping migration of a project.
