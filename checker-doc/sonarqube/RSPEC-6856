"@PathVariable" annotation should be present if a path variable is used
The @PathVariable annotation in Spring extracts values from the URI path and binds them to method parameters in a Spring MVC controller. It is commonly used with @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping to capture path variables from the URI. These annotations map HTTP requests to specific handler methods in a controller. They are part of the Spring Web module and are commonly used to define the routes for different HTTP operations in a RESTful API. If a method has a path template containing a placeholder, like "/api/resource/{id}", and there’s no @PathVariable annotation on a method parameter to capture the id path variable, Spring will disregard the id variable. This rule will raise an issue if a method has a path template with a placeholder, but no corresponding @PathVariable, or vice-versa.
