Set appropriate Status Codes on HTTP responses
The request handler function in a Controller should set the appropriate HTTP status code based on the operation’s success or failure. This is done by returning a Response object with the appropriate status code. If an exception is thrown during the execution of the handler, the status code should be in the range of 4xx or 5xx. Examples of such codes are BAD_REQUEST, UNAUTHORIZED, FORBIDDEN, NOT_FOUND, INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, BAD_GATEWAY, SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, etc. The status code should be 1xx, 2xx, or 3xx if no exception is thrown and the operation is considered successful. Such codes include OK, CREATED, MOVED_PERMANENTLY, FOUND, etc.
