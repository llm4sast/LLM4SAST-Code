AssertJ "assertThatThrownBy" should not be used alone
Unlike similar AssertJ methods testing exceptions ( assertThatCode(), assertThatExceptionOfType(), …​), the assertThatThrownBy() method can be used alone, failing if the code did not raise any exception. Still, only testing that an exception was raised is not enough to guarantee that it was the expected one, and you should test the exception type or content further. In addition, it will make explicit what you are expecting, without relying on side-effects.
