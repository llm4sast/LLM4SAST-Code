JUnit assertions should not be used in "run" methods
JUnit assertions should not be made from the run method of a Runnable, because their failure may not be detected in the test that initiated them. Failed assertions throw assertion errors. However, if the error is thrown from another thread than the one that initiated the test, the thread will exit but the test will not fail.
