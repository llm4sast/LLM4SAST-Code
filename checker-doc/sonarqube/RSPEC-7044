Server-side requests should not be vulnerable to traversing attacks
Path Traversal Server-Side Request Forgery is a sub-class of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). In this type of attack, the attacker manipulates the path of the URL in the server-side request, rather than controlling the entire URL. This can lead to unauthorized access to endpoints or data by altering the request path. Path Traversal SSRF attacks are dangerous because they can exploit the server-side application’s ability to send requests to internal resources that are typically inaccessible to external attackers. By manipulating the path, attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information or functionalities that should be protected. What is the potential impact? The impact of SSRF vulnerabilities can vary greatly depending on the context in which the user input is used. API Traversal In a path traversal SSRF attack, the attacker can manipulate the path of the server-side request to traverse through different endpoints of an API. This can lead to several potential impacts: Unauthorized access to API endpoints By manipulating the path of the server-side request, an attacker can potentially access API endpoints that are not intended to be publicly accessible. This could include endpoints that provide access to sensitive data or functionality. Unauthorized access to these endpoints could lead to data breaches or unauthorized actions being performed on the server. Manipulation of API responses If an attacker can manipulate the path of a server-side request to traverse to different API endpoints, they could potentially influence the responses that the server sends back. This could lead to incorrect or misleading data being returned, which could have a variety of impacts depending on the nature of the application and the data involved.
