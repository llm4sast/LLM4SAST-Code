Non-singleton Spring beans should not be injected into singleton beans
In Spring the scope of a bean defines the lifecycle and visibility of that bean in the Spring container. There are six scopes: Singleton: default, one instance per Spring container Prototype : a new instance per bean request Request : a new instance per HTTP request Session : a new instance per HTTP session Application: a new instance per ServletContext Websocket : a new instance per Websocket session The last four scopes mentioned, request, session, application and websocket, are only available in a web-aware application.
