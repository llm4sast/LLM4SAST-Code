Assertion arguments should be passed in the correct order
The standard assertions library methods such as org.junit.Assert.assertEquals, and org.junit.Assert.assertSame expect the first argument to be the expected value and the second argument to be the actual value. For AssertJ instead, the argument of org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat is the actual value, and the subsequent calls contain the expected values. What is the potential impact? Having the expected value and the actual value in the wrong order will not alter the outcome of tests, (succeed/fail when it should) but the error messages will contain misleading information.
