Loop conditions should be true at least once
A for loop is a fundamental programming construct used to execute a block of code repeatedly. However, if the loop’s condition is false before the first iteration, the loop will never execute. for(int i = 0; i < 0; i++) { // Noncompliant: the condition is always false, and the loop will never execute // ... } Rewrite the loop to ensure the condition evaluates to true at least once. for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { // Compliant: the condition is true at least once, the loop will execute // ... } This bug has the potential to cause unexpected outcomes as the loop might contain critical code that needs to be executed.
