Loops should not contain more than a single "break" or "continue" statement
The use of break and continue statements increases the complexity of the control flow and makes it harder to understand the program logic. In order to keep a good program structure, they should not be applied more than once per loop. This rule reports an issue when there is more than one break or continue statement in a loop. The code should be refactored to increase readability if there is more than one.
