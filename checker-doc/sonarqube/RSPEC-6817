Use of the "@Async" annotation on methods declared within a "@Configuration" class in Spring Boot
@Configuration is a class-level annotation indicating that an object is a source of bean definitions. @Configuration classes declare beans through @Bean -annotated methods. Calls to @Bean methods on @Configuration classes can also be used to define inter-bean dependencies. The @Bean annotation indicates that a method instantiates, configures, and initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container. Annotating a method of a bean with @Async will make it execute in a separate thread. In other words, the caller will not wait for the completion of the called method. The @Async annotation is not supported on methods declared within a @Configuration class. This is because @Async methods are typically used for asynchronous processing, and they require certain infrastructure to be set up, which may not be available or appropriate in a @Configuration class.
