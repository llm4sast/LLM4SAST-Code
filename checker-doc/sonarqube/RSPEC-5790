JUnit5 inner test classes should be annotated with @Nested
If not annotated with @Nested, an inner class containing some tests will never be executed during tests execution. While you could still be able to manually run its tests in an IDE, it won’t be the case during the build. By contrast, a static nested class containing some tests should not be annotated with @Nested, JUnit5 will not share setup and state with an instance of its enclosing class.
