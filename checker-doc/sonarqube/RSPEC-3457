Format strings should be used correctly
A printf- -style format string is a string that contains placeholders, usually represented by special characters such as "%s" or "{}", depending on the technology in use. These placeholders are replaced by values when the string is printed or logged. Because printf -style format strings are interpreted at runtime, rather than validated by the compiler, they can contain errors that result in the wrong strings being created. This rule checks whether every format string specifier can be correctly matched with one of the additional arguments when calling the following methods: java.lang.String#format java.util.Formatter#format java.io.PrintStream#format java.text.MessageFormat#format java.io.PrintWriter#format java.io.PrintStream#printf java.io.PrintWriter#printf java.lang.String#formatted (since Java 15) logging methods of org.slf4j.Logger, java.util.logging.Logger, org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger.
