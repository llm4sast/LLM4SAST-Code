Getters and setters should be synchronized in pairs
A synchronized method is a method marked with the synchronized keyword, meaning it can only be accessed by one thread at a time. If multiple threads try to access the synchronized method simultaneously, they will be blocked until the method is available. Synchronized methods prevent race conditions and data inconsistencies in multi-threaded environments. Ensuring that only one thread can access a method at a time, prevents multiple threads from modifying the same data simultaneously, and causing conflicts. When one part of a getter/setter pair is synchronized the other should be too. Failure to synchronize both sides may result in inconsistent behavior at runtime as callers access an inconsistent method state.
