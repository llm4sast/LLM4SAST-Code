"wait(...)" should be used instead of "Thread.sleep(...)" when a lock is held
In a multithreaded environment, a thread may need to wait for a particular condition to become true. One way of pausing execution in Java is Thread.sleep(…​). If a thread that holds a lock calls Thread.sleep(…​), no other thread can acquire said lock. This can lead to performance and scalability issues, in the worst case leading to deadlocks.
