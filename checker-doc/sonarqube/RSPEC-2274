"Object.wait(...)" and "Condition.await(...)" should be called inside a "while" loop
In a multithreaded environment, the Object.wait(…​), as well as Condition.await(…​) and similar methods are used to pause the execution of a thread until the thread is awakened. A thread is typically awakened when it is notified, signaled, or interrupted, usually because of an event in another thread requiring some subsequent action by the waiting thread. However, a thread may be awakened despite the desired condition not being met or the desired event not having happened. This is referred to as "spurious wakeups" and may be caused by underlying platform semantics. In other words, a thread may be awakened due to reasons that have nothing to do with the business logic. Hence, the assumption that the desired condition is met or the desired event occurred after a thread is awakened does not always hold.
