Unused local variables should be removed
An unused local variable is a variable that has been declared but is not used anywhere in the block of code where it is defined. It is dead code, contributing to unnecessary complexity and leading to confusion when reading the code. Therefore, it should be removed from your code to maintain clarity and efficiency. What is the potential impact? Having unused local variables in your code can lead to several issues: Decreased Readability: Unused variables can make your code more difficult to read. They add extra lines and complexity, which can distract from the main logic of the code. Misunderstanding : When other developers read your code, they may wonder why a variable is declared but not used. This can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the code’s intent. Potential for Bugs : If a variable is declared but not used, it might indicate a bug or incomplete code.
