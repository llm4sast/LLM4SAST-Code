"for" loop increment clauses should modify the loops' counters
The counter of a for loop should be updated in the loop’s increment clause. The purpose of a for loop is to iterate over a range using a counter variable. It should not be used for other purposes, and alternative loops should be used in those cases. If the counter is not updated, the loop will be infinite with a constant counter variable. If this is intentional, use a while or do while loop instead of a for loop. If the counter variable is updated within the loop’s body, try to move it to the increment clause. If this is impossible due to certain conditions, replace the for loop with a while or do while loop.
