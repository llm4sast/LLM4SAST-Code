@EventListener methods should have one parameter at most
Spring provides the @EventListener annotation as a simpler alternative to implementing the ApplicationListener interface for handling events. The @EventListener annotation registers a method as an event handler. This allows to skip the implementation of the ApplicationListener interface, making it easier to handle events. The @EventListener annotation can only be used on methods that have at most one parameter, which should be the specific event that we want to handle. To listen to several types of events, use the classes argument of the @EventListener annotation.
