"deleteOnExit" should not be used
Use of File.deleteOnExit() is not recommended for the following reasons: The deletion occurs only in the case of a normal JVM shutdown but not when the JVM crashes or is killed. For each file handler, the memory associated with the handler is released only at the end of the process.
