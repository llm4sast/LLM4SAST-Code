Annotated Mockito objects should be initialized
Objects annotated with Mockito annotations @Mock, @Spy, @Captor, or @InjectMocks need to be initialized explicitly. There are several ways to do this: Call MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this) or MockitoAnnotations.initMocks(this) in a setup method Annotate test class with @RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class) (JUnit 4) Annotate test class with @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class) (JUnit 5 Jupiter) Use @Rule public MockitoRule rule = MockitoJUnit.rule(); Test using uninitialized mocks will fail. Note that this only applies to annotated Mockito objects. It is not necessary to initialize objects instantiated via Mockito.mock() or Mockito.spy().
