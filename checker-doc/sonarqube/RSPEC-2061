Custom serialization methods should have required signatures
Java offers a built-in serialization mechanism for classes that implement the Serializable interface. The developer can either rely on Java’s default serialization and deserialization logic or implement custom methods for these tasks. The JVM will use methods such as readObject and writeObject to execute custom behavior. This only works, however, if these methods match exactly the expected signatures. If they do not, the JVM will fall back to the default logic, resulting in unexpected behavior at runtime, while the developer believes that the default logic has been overidden.
