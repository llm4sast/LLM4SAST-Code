Floating point numbers should not be tested for equality
Floating point math is imprecise because of the challenges of storing such values in a binary representation. Even worse, floating point math is not associative; push a float or a double through a series of simple mathematical operations and the answer will be different based on the order of those operation because of the rounding that takes place at each step.
