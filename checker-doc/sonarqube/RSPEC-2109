Reflection should not be used to check non-runtime annotations
Denoted by the "@" symbol, annotations are metadata that can be added to classes, methods, and variables for various purposes such as documentation, code analysis, and runtime processing. Annotations have retention policies that determine in which context they are retained and available for use. There are three retention policies for annotations: RetentionPolicy.SOURCE - Annotations are only available during compilation and code analysis. They are not included in the compiled class file and are not available at runtime. E.G. @Override, @SuppressWarnings RetentionPolicy.CLASS - Annotations are included in the compiled class file providing information to the compiler, but they are not retained by the JVM at runtime. This is the default retention policy. E.G. @PreviewFeature RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME - Annotations are included in the compiled class file and available at runtime. They can be accessed and used by the program through reflection. E.G. @FunctionalInterface, @Deprecated It is important to understand that only annotations having the RUNTIME retention policy can be accessed at runtime using reflection.
