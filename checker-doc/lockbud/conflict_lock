In Rust, a conflict lock occurs when two or more threads acquire locks in conflicting orders, which can lead to a deadlock. For instance, suppose Thread A acquires Lock L1 and then attempts to acquire Lock L2. At the same time, Thread B acquires Lock L2 and then tries to acquire Lock L1. If these operations happen simultaneously, a circular dependency is formed. That is, Thread A is waiting for Thread B to release Lock L2, while Thread B is waiting for Thread A to release Lock L1. As a result, both threads are blocked, and the program freezes.
