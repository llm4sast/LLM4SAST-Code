Invalid free is a memory safety issue. It refers to the act of freeing memory that has not been properly allocated, has already been freed, or should not be freed, which violates memory management rules and can lead to undefined behavior in the program. In the research, a common scenario is that due to a structure assignment operation, a structure containing an uninitialized memory buffer is freed prematurely, resulting in the invalid freeing of heap memory. This is different from what happens in traditional programming languages.
